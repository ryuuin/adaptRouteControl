### Â Simulator: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), Traci interface.
###  Roadnetwork: 7x7 roadnetworks, each road is bi-directional and has different road length 
###  Vehicles randomly join the road network with random origin and destinations. 
###  Arrival rate of vehicles is 0.16 vehicles per second
###  Run simulations for 5400 seconds in simulated road network and collect vehicle delay data to calculate average vehicle delay.
